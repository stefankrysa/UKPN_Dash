# Solar PV Uptake by LSOA

This project analyses Solar PV uptake at LSOA level, combining geospatial connection data with population statistics to identify areas with high solar potential but low adoption.

## Files
- `processing.ipynb` — Cleans and aggregates Solar PV connection data, computes uptake and priority metrics, and outputs a model table.
- `app.py` — Streamlit dashboard for exploring Solar PV uptake, potential, and priority areas interactively.
